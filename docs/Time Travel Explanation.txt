You would begin in Act 1, or 1995. Once you complete 1995 you would then have access to the Delorean. It would allow you to travel to 5 different years however the 5th is locked. To unlock it you have to complete the other 4 years. The 5th is sort of a finale type. The other 4 years allow you to travel between them as you wish, when you wish. For example, you start 1989, get up to Night 3 then you travel to 1993, get to Night 4 then go back and finish 1989. You can do that. Instead of calling them "Acts" and making you complete them linearly, they are instead called "Years" or "Eras" and can be completed non-linearly.
