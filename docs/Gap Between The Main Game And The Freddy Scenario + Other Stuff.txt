The Freddy Scenario canon 1994 year ends on May 26th, 1994 while Act 1 of the main game begins on September 26th, 1995. That's an almost year and a half gap between the Freddy Scenario and the main game. I had an idea for a standalone game once I'm finished with The Adventures of Bonnie. The game will take place between the two and show what happened between the events of the Scenario and the main game.

Also the name for the potential Adventures of Bonnie sequel is The Adventures of Bonnie: The Greater Enemy

The standalone game that takes place between the Scenario and the main game will be called The Adventures of Bonnie: The Return of a Legend. The name is based off my previous game that I was working on, called Five Night at Fuckboy's: The Return of a Legend. FNaFb: TRoaL was cancelled due to me losing the files however the Freddy Scenario in The Adventures of Bonnie will have remade locations and events that happened in TRoaL. There will be a trilogy similar to the FNaFb trilogy; The Adventures of Bonnie: The Return of a Legend, The Adventures of Bonnie 2: The Original Game and The Adventures of Bonnie 3: The Greater Enemy.

The first to be released will be The Adventures of Bonnie 2: The Original Game then the prequel The Adventures of Bonnie: The Return of a Legend and finally the sequel The Adventures of Bonnie 3: The Greater Enemy

scratch the Freddy Scenario, it's gonna be taken out and put into the prequel game.
